We are the Cyber Security Society, known as CyberSoc, at the University of Liverpool. Our mission is to create a welcoming environment for students to explore the realms of security and hacking in an enjoyable and secure way.

Our main activities include organizing engaging workshops, hosting informative talks by industry professionals, and participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. However, we are constantly on the lookout for fresh event ideas and opportunities to connect with new individuals who share our passion!
