We're the Cyber Security Society - Aka CyberSoc - at the University of Liverpool, we aim to provide a home for students to learn more about security and hacking in a fun, safe manner.

We primarily organise workshops, hold talks from industry and compete in CTFs but we're always looking for new events to run and people to meet!
